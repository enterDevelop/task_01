= How can I convert from my existing accounting system? =

* The PhreeSoft help files have information on how to convert from your current system. There is a free PhreeBooks R3.7 conversion tool available through the PhreeSoft store. Others may be available, or, if not, use the `Line in the Sand` approach.

= Which chart of accounts do I use? =

* There are a few common standard charts included. You can select one of these as a base to complete the install. After that you may add/delete chart accounts manually or import a completely new chart of accounts.
